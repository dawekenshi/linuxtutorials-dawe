    <p class="post1-p">This post is going to be kind of an introduction one the rest are going to be about other topics that I want to talk about.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="post1-p">Today I made this website thinking about new users to linux im kind of one myself but I think I can at least try to explain somethings in spanish (becasue there are more linux content creators that are english speakers) and maybe do tutorials on requests just kind of wanted to help the community, I am 14 years old and I started to use linux since I was 13 so like a year ago or so but I started going more deep and learning more about it a few months ago so im not an expert at all, a few days ago I finally managed to install Gentoo which to me was really complicated I tryed a few times before but I couldn't manage to get a desktop enviroment working.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="post1-p">It was all for todays post I've only wanted to introduce me a bit and what I want to do if someone has any recomenndation about changes in the webs or improvements in the code that I could make let me know please!.</p>
